## ‚ú® Features

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Powered by a sophisticated language model to understand user intent.
* **Agentic Behavior:** Can autonomously decide which tool or API to use based on the user's query.
* **Multi-API Integration:** Seamlessly connects to external services like TMDB and Yelp to provide rich, real-time information.
* **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the context of the conversation for a more natural interaction.
* **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new tools and API integrations.

## üõ†Ô∏è API Integrations

This chatbot leverages powerful external APIs to provide a wide range of functionalities.

### The Movie Database (TMDB) API üé¨

To handle all movie and TV show-related queries, the chatbot integrates with the **TMDB API**. This allows the agent to access a massive, community-built database of film and television content.

* **Functionality:**
    * Fetch detailed information about specific movies (e.g., "Tell me about the movie Inception").
    * Get a list of popular, top-rated, or currently playing movies.
    * Find movies based on genre, actor, or director.
    * Provide personalized movie recommendations.
* **Usage Example:** A user asking, "What other movies has Christopher Nolan directed?" will trigger the TMDB tool to fetch the relevant filmography.



### Yelp Fusion API  Yelp

For location-based and local business queries, the chatbot uses the **Yelp Fusion API**. This enables the agent to act as a local guide, helping users discover businesses, restaurants, and services around them.

* **Functionality:**
    * Search for local businesses by category (e.g., "Find coffee shops near me").
    * Get details about a specific business, including its rating, address, phone number, and reviews.
    * Find the best local spots based on user preferences (e.g., "top-rated Italian restaurants in downtown").
* **Usage Example:** A user query like, "I'm looking for a good place for dinner in Hyderabad" prompts the agent to use the Yelp tool to search for highly-rated restaurants in that city.

## üì∏ Chatbot in Action: Conversational Flows

Here‚Äôs a look at how the chatbot handles real-world scenarios, from a simple greeting to complex, multi-step queries.

### 1. Simple Greeting

The conversation starts with a simple, natural interaction.

### 2. Movie Suggestions (Multi-Step Query)

This example showcases how the agent gathers information to provide personalized movie recommendations using **The Movie Database (TMDB)**.

#### Step 1: Initial Request

The user asks for a recommendation without providing any context.

#### Step 2: Gathering Context & Delivering Results

The user provides a movie they like. The agent uses this context to query the TMDB API and fetches detailed information, summarizing the results in a list.

### 3. Restaurant Recommendations (Complex Conversational Flow)

This flow demonstrates the agent's ability to handle ambiguity by asking clarifying questions until it has enough information to use the **Yelp API**.

#### Step 1: Vague Initial Request

The user asks for restaurants but provides no specific details. The AI asks for the necessary information.

#### Step 2: Partial Information Provided

The user provides some, but not all, of the required details. The AI recognizes what's missing and asks for it specifically.

#### Step 3: All Information Gathered & Action Executed

The user provides the final piece of information. The agent now has everything it needs. It queries the Yelp API, retrieves a list of matching restaurants, and presents them with a helpful summary.
