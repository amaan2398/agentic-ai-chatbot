## üõ†Ô∏è API Integrations

This chatbot leverages powerful external APIs to provide a wide range of functionalities.

### The Movie Database (TMDB) API üé¨

To handle all movie and TV show-related queries, the chatbot integrates with the **TMDB API**. This allows the agent to access a massive, community-built database of film and television content.

* **Functionality:**
    * Fetch detailed information about specific movies (e.g., "Tell me about the movie Inception").
    * Get a list of popular, top-rated, or currently playing movies.
    * Find movies based on genre, actor, or director.
    * Provide personalized movie recommendations.
* **Usage Example:** A user asking, "What other movies has Christopher Nolan directed?" will trigger the TMDB tool to fetch the relevant filmography.



### Yelp Fusion API  Yelp

For location-based and local business queries, the chatbot uses the **Yelp Fusion API**. This enables the agent to act as a local guide, helping users discover businesses, restaurants, and services around them.

* **Functionality:**
    * Search for local businesses by category (e.g., "Find coffee shops near me").
    * Get details about a specific business, including its rating, address, phone number, and reviews.
    * Find the best local spots based on user preferences (e.g., "top-rated Italian restaurants in downtown").
* **Usage Example:** A user query like, "I'm looking for a good place for dinner in Hyderabad" prompts the agent to use the Yelp tool to search for highly-rated restaurants in that city.
